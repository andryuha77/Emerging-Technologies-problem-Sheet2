# Emerging-Technologies-problem-Sheet2
Solutions to problem sheet 2 for [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/) module.
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics.
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

# Problems - Read Digits Image Files
These problems relate to the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set.
Save your work as a Python file, or a collection of Python files.
Create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store the files, complete with a README.
The dataset is in quite a compact format, and must be manipulated for us to investigate it.


## 1. Read the image files
Download the image and label files, have Python decompress them and read them byte by byte into appropriate data structures in memory.


## 2. Output an image to the console
Output the third image in the training set to the console.
Do this by representing any pixel value less than 128 as a full stop and any other pixel value as a hash symbol.


## 3. Output the image files as PNGs
Use Python to output the image files as PNGs, saving them in a subfolder in your repository.
